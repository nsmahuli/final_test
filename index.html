      <h2>How to use this site</h2>
      <p>
        Each season has its ownpage with a small, curated collection of movies and TV shows that match the
        vibe of that time of year. Every title also has a suggested food or drink pairing to go along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow the season that calls to you — something in bloom, something sunlit, something autumn-crisp, or something snowy — and build your perfect watch night.

      <h2>A year of seasons</h2>
      <ol class="timeline-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Spring · March – May</strong><br />
          Temperatures start warming up, days slowly get longer, and everything begins to grow again. Flowers bloom, trees bud, and the world feels like it’s waking up after winter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Summer · June – August</strong><br />
          The warmest months of the year, with the longest days and the most sunlight. It’s a season of clear skies, late sunsets, buzzing insects, and spending more time outside.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fall · September – November</strong><br />
          Cooler air moves in, leaves change color, and daylight starts to fade earlier. It’s a transitional season where nature slows down and everything gets a little cozier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Winter · December – February</strong><br />
          The coldest, darkest part of the year, with short days and quiet landscapes. Trees go bare, animals hibernate, and the season leans into stillness, snow, and staying warm.
        </li>
